The mass spec processing goal is to obtain the ion intensities for each MRM and export them to an Excel file. It is based on in house scripts that sum up the ion intensities of each MRM scan over the time of acquisition and attribute them tentative IDs by matching the MRMs with local, or user-input library.  The tentative IDs are at even-chain lipid species level and based on the LIPID MAPS® Structure Database (LMSD). The LMSD is a relational database encompassing structures and annotations of biologically relevant lipids.  
 
This dataset contains the following 3 folders: 
 
Cells-Lipids-Nature2021 
Media-Lipids-Nature2021 
Cell-Media-Metabolites-Nature2021 
 
The two sample groups are control and reactive astrocytes (Cells and media). They are named as C and R. 
 
C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 = Control Astrocytes 
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 = Reactive Astrocytes 
 
The 10 main lipid classes scanned are: 
AC = Acylcarnitines 
CE = Cholysteryl esters 
cer = Ceramides 
FFA = Free fatty acids 
Lyso_PE = Phosphatidylethanolamine 
Lyso_PG = Phosphatidylglycerol 
Lyso_PI = Phosphatidylinositol  
Lyso_PS = Phoshatidylserine 
LysoPC_PC = Phosphatidylcholine 
TAG1 = Triacylglycerols 
TAG2 = Triacylglycerols 
 
fullmass = fullmass scan 
QC = quality control  
 
The metabolites are scanned on the positive ion mode (POS1, POS2) or the negative ion mode (NEG1, NEG2).
